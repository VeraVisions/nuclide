### fullbrightMap {#fullbrightMap}

#### Syntax

**fullbrightMap <texturepath/texturename>**

#### Overview

The texture is essentially a fullbright overlay on top of the
diffuse/albedomap.

Not all [Shaders](Shaders.md) support them. In some, like the
[unlit](unlit.md) shader, the
[diffusemap](diffusemap.md) is always
fullbright.
