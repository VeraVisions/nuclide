## vmap_surfacelightdistance
### Syntax

**vmap_surfaceLightDistance \<scale\>**

### Overview

Increases the range of a surfacelight. This is different from increasing
the [vmap_surfaceLight (Material Command)](@ref vmap_surfaceLight) value, as
it'll travel much wider without affecting the total intensity of the
light.
