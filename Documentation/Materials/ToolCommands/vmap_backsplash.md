## vmap_backsplash
### Syntax

**vmap_backsplash \<percent\> \<distance\>**

### Overview

Controls the percentage of [surfacelight](@ref vmap_surfaceLight) backsplash (how
much light the emitting surface hits), as well as the distant away from
the surface of which it is cast. This is really tricky to get right in
tight areas, so put time aside to experiment.

**The default backsplash amount is 5%, and the default distance is about
16 units.**
