## program
**program** defines which GLSL/HLSL shader to load for a defined
material. It also accepts arguments that will recompile a shader with
certain permutations. This is kinda ugly,

Starting in **The Wastes 1.2**, there are the
following shader programs available to you:

-   program [unlit](unlit.md)
-   program [lightmapped](lightmapped.md)
-   program [vertexlit](vertexlit.md)
-   program [water](water.md)
-   program [refract](refract.md)
