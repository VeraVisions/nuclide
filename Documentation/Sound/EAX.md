# Sound: EFX {#EFX}

## EAX
Creative Technology's **Environmental Audio Extensions**, also known as **EAX**, attempted to create more ambiance within video games by more accurately simulating a real-world audio environment.


The release of Windows Vista deprecated the DirectSound3D API on which EAX relied on in 2007, so Creative Technology encouraged the move to OpenAL's EFX.
