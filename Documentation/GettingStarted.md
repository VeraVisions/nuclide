# Getting started

## How to get the latest version {#how}

You clone the Nuclide git repository first. There's multiple places to get it, one such place may be GitHub:

`git clone https://github.com/veravisions/nuclide`

You can then update the git repository as you normally would. Using `git pull` for example.

And then you can [get started on building the engine and the rest of the toolchain](Building.md). Alternatively, you can also move in the official FTEQW binaries into the Nuclide directory to get started without bootstrapping your own engine + QuakeC compiler.
C programming knowledge is not required to use Nuclide itself.
