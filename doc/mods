Mod loading and setting up games
================================

For mods to show up in the "Custom Game" menu, we have to either find a manifest
file, or a liblist.gam, or a gameinfo.txt inside the respective mod directory.

It'll scan .pk3 and .pk4 archives, as well as loose files in the mod directory,
however it will not search inside any sub-directories.
It is trying to look inside the dlcache/ folder, but the engine is currently
restricting that.

A liblist.gam file can look something like this:

game "My Cool Mod"
version "1.0"
startmap "e1m1"
trainingmap "traininglevel"

But more definitions are available.
Check src/menu-fn/m_customgame.qc's customgame_liblist_parse() function to stay
up to date regarding all the supported liblist variables that can be set.

GameInfo.txt files are supported too. They originate from the Source Engine
filesystem, however there's no concept of Tools and Game AppIDs as Nuclide does
not link against Steamworks.
Support for such definitions is complementary and I'd advise not to expect it
to be feature complete. It has a concept of inheriting multiple paths as defined
by the specification.

If you need more control, you can use manifest files. Similar to the default.fmf
that's in the root Nuclide source tree. You can set liblist entries like this
inside of them:

-set gameinfo_game "My Cool Mod"
-set gameinfo_version "1.0"
-set gameinfo_startmap "e1m1"
-set gameinfo_trainingmap "traininglevel"

Please name the manifest the same as the mod/game dir. For example if your game
its directory is named "foobar" name your manifest "foobar.fmf".

That's all there is to know about mod-detection in Nuclide its menu progs.
