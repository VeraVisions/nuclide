My fonts are all free.  You can use them for personal or commercial projects,
and I ask for no money.  I would, however, love to hear from you.  If you use
my fonts for something please e-mail me letting me know how you used it.  Send
me a copy if you can or let me know where I can find your work. You are under
no obligation to do this, I just like to see how my fonts get used.

About the font:

White Rabbit is reminiscent of the characters displayed on all those
old low-res terminal screens. Smoothed out and cleaned up for 1999,
this is the font to use for all your computing applications.
