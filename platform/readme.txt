III. PRIVACY POLICY
 
The software may connect to the Internet to enable features such as a real-time chat room application, or to get dynamic listings of open multiplayer games from a master-server. The software may also broadcast the users' public internet address and game-server metadata to said master-server to enable other users the ability to establish a direct connection to you, the user. 
 
If you're not in any way approving of these features, do not use the Multiplayer option for either 'Internet games' or 'Chat rooms', or stop using the software entirely.
