# Nuclide

Nuclide is a cross-platform game development kit. It is powered by FTE QuakeWorld and intended for developers.

For more information, [visit the online manual](https://developer.vera-visions.com).

## Trying the Latest

Ensure you have FTE QuakeWorld, or are comfortable building it yourself.
You can build a copy of FTEQW using the command `make engine`.
*If that is a lot to bootstrap, you can use any recent binary version.*

Run the engine in the root of this repository, after having issued `make progs GAME=base`.

## Building Documentation

You can build your own offline version of the online manual by running `doxygen` in the root of this repository. The output will be under **Documentation/html/index.html**.
