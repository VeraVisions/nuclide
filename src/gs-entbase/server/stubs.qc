# OVERVIEW
Player spawn position for single-player games.

# KEYS
- "targetname" : Name

# NOTES
This entity is also used in Counter-Strike (2000) and its beta versions to mark
spawn-positions for the Counter-Terrorist team.

In order for a player to spawn here, the game needs to be in singleplayer mode
or multiplayer coop (if info_player_coop spawn points don't exist).

Mods may choose to have additional fields that are not documented here as part
of the entity, keep that in mind.

# TRIVIA
This entity was introduced in Quake (1996).

# NOTES
This entity is also used in Counter-Strike (2000) and its beta versions to mark

In order for a player to spawn here, the game needs to be in a compatible
multiplayer mode. This (with the exception of Counter-Strike) excludes team
based modes.

# OVERVIEW
Player spawn position for cooperative games.

# KEYS
- "targetname" : Name

# NOTES
In order for a player to spawn here, the game needs to take place on a map
for singleplayer with cooperative multiplayer enabled.
If this entity isn't present on such a mode, info_player_start will be the
fallback spawn-point.

Mods may choose to have additional fields that are not documented here as part
of the entity, keep that in mind.
