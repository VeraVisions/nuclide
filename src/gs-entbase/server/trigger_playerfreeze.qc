/*!QUAKED trigger_playerfreeze (.5 .5 .5) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)
# OVERVIEW
Trigger that freezes all clients, until it is triggered again.
Freezing a player means they're unable to move, they can still look around.

# KEYS
- "targetname" : Name
- "killtarget" : Target to kill when triggered.

# NOTES
Ideas: Add ability to supress looking around, firing weapons, using items
and so on.

# TRIVIA
This entity was introduced in Opposing Force (1999).
