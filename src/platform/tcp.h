    @brief TCP/IP Networking API

    The TCP API manages the sending/receiving of data over TCP sockets.

    First, establish a connection with TCP_Connect(), which will return
	 a file descriptior.
	 If TCP_Connect returns a value below 0, no connection is possible.
    You can send data through TCP_Send() once TCP_GetState returns
    STATE_CONNECTED.

    You need to run TCP_Frame() on your tcpinfo_t struct every frame
    in order to listen to network activity.
